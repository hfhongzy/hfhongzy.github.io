<p>During the summer vacation of 2024, I signed a contract with Xinyou (known as X-Camp in the US), a competitive programming educational company, to teach an advanced high school class, which is the second most challenging level out of the seven offered. My qualifications for this role included a silver medal in the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) in 2021 and qualification for the 47th International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals.</p>
<p>When my friend Mang introduced me to this opportunity, it was difficult to refuse. The salary was sufficient to cover my expenses for the next two years, and the job required only four hours of work per day. Thus, I accepted the offer without much hesitation.</p>
<p>However, the job did not turn out to be as fulfilling as I had hoped. Balancing this part-time job with my research responsibilities at school proved challenging. I often felt overwhelmed by anxiety and depression. A few weeks later, I realized that I needed to take responsibility for my decision. I also acknowledged that my constant worry about failure and criticism was counterproductive. Consequently, I adjusted my mindset to be more determined, resilient to stress, and less concerned about others’ opinions.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there were several benefits. Financially, I earned a significant amount, which made my life over the next two years more comfortable and less stressful. Additionally, I experienced several personal growth opportunities:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Public Speaking</strong>: I gained confidence in sharing my knowledge and opinions in front of a group, which was previously a challenge for me. I now feel much more comfortable with public speaking.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Managing Anxiety</strong>: I reduced my anxiety about not being fully prepared or completing tasks. I had previously spent excessive time ensuring everything was done correctly, which affected my efficiency and revealed my fragile mindset. Through experiences of not performing perfectly, I learned to focus on maximizing efficiency and managing anxiety.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Communication Skills</strong>: I interacted with students of varying personalities, including those who tend to lose patience. These interactions provided valuable experience and exposed me to diverse situations, making me more adaptable and calm in unexpected communication scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Insight into Company Operations</strong>: I gained an understanding of how a company operates, particularly from a human resources perspective. Learning how to effectively communicate with students, parents, administrators, and third-party service providers was an important and valuable experience.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, it has been a little painful but surprisingly beneficial month. I hope that in the next stage, I can focus on my research topics as well as continue to further my socialization.</p>
